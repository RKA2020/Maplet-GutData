# **Maplet_in_Microbiome_Analysis**

Maplet is an R package for statistical data analysis specifically focusing on metabolomics datasets (Chetnik et al. "maplet: An extensible for modular and reproducible omics pipelines". Bioinformatics, 2021). 

To get started with Maplet, you need to install the latest stable version of maplet using the following command:

,,, devtools::install_github(repo="krumsieklab/maplet@v1.2.1", subdir="maplet") ,,, 

Additional information about the installation of maplet and examples on how to use maplet can be found on the git hub page of the package [here](https://github.com/krumsieklab/maplet). 


# **The Aim of this Project**

The usage of multi-omics and bioinformatics approaches in the gut microbiome and metabolome field has gained more attention recently. 

Here, we used "Maplet" and R to analyze a publicly available dataset from the paper "Gut microbiome structure and metabolic activity in inflammatory bowel disease" (Franzosa et al., 2019). [Link to publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6342642/pdf/nihms-1510763.pdf). 

We did that to: 
     
      1- Check the feasibility of using Maplet in metabolome and gut microbiome data analysis 
      2- Check the reproducibility of the results generated from the article 

# **Getting Started with the Project**

To get started, we first downloaded and saved the supplementary dataset from the above paper. You can find the available supplementary data [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6342642/).

We then saved a version
