# **Maplet_in_Microbiome_Analysis**

Maplet is an R package for statistical data analysis specifically focusing on metabolomics datasets (Chetnik et al. "maplet: An extensible for modular and reproducible omics pipelines". Bioinformatics, 2021). 

The usage of multi-omics and bioinformatics approaches in the gut microbiome and metabolome field has gained more attention recently. 

Here, we will use "Maplet" to analyze a publicly available dataset from the paper "Gut microbiome structure and metabolic activity in inflammatory bowel disease" (Franzosa et al., 2019). [Link to publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6342642/pdf/nihms-1510763.pdf). 

The aim of the project is to 
     
      1- Check the feasibility of using Maplet in gut microbiome data analysis 
      2- Check the reproducibility of the results generated from the article
