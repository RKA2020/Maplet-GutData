# The published data has two datasets for the metabolome and microbiome data (PRISM: 155 samples and validation cohort: 65 samples)

# As a start, we focused our analysis on the metabolites part of the PRISM samples. 

# Here, you will find the excel file we used for the analysis under the name "Metabolome_data.xlsx"

# The excel file contains three sheets (Metabolome_metadata_PRISM, Metabolite_abundance_PRISM, and the Metabolite_features)

# You can save the excel file into your work directory 

# Please adjust the codes based on "your" location of the downloaded excel file before running the code
